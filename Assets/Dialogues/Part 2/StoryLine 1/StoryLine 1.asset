  sentences:
  - The mysterious sphere again began to make a strange sound, and then some voices
    began to appear in my head.
  - ' - Report completed mission!'
  - ' - Yes, sir! As usual, we found a small farm in the forest to steal a cow.'
  - ' - With me was Gank and one of the killer fighting bunnies who kept us safe...'
  - The voices broke off.
  - " - What are these voices in my head? Why do they need our cows? Are they aliens?\r"
  - It looks like it.
