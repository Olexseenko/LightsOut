  sentences:
  - Dead silence was reigning over the courtyard which was full of metallic smell
    of blood.
  - Poor cows lie in their own blood in the farthest  corner, and near them there
    was a furious beast, which, in a fit of rage, tore their bodies to pieces.
  - ' - My God, what happened here?'
  - Leave questions for later, the killer is guarding something, maybe it will help
    to find out where your mom has disappeared?
